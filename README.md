# Holdlook
Holdlook Minecraft Mod

![Holdlook](https://github.com/Cats1337/holdlook/blob/main/holdlook/src/main/resources/holdlook.png?raw=true)
This mod adds a simple one button to go from first to third person. There's currently no toggle feature, only hold, but I plan to add a toggle if people request it / people use this mod.

I made this mod because Hypixel blacklisted the perspective mod, and Lunar Client and BadLion didn't have their 'Snaplook' type mod public so I just made it myself...

**Default Keybinds**: _Can be changed in settings_<br>
**L-Alt** - Back View (Over Shoulder)<br>
**None** - Front View
